MOCK DRONE STREAMER - TODO

[ ] Modularize drone_worker() function
    - Extract NetworkManager class (socket, connection handling)
    - Extract DroneStatistics class (frames sent/failed, bytes tracking)
    - Extract DroneWorker class (main worker logic)
    - Break 200+ line function into focused, testable components

[ ] maybe add rtsp
